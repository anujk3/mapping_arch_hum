## Comments on Final Project Proposals

### Mapping Pothole Repair Times in New York City
* The project is straight forward and clear.
* However, I wonder if investigating pothole repair is that interesting. If you want to measure how low income communities in New York City receive less attention and investment, surely there are more pertinent ways of doing this than by looking at pothole repair data.
* Are there other things that you can measure that would be much more relevant to low income communities? A lot of the residents in those communities don't drive, so probably they would care about other things more.
* Unless you can really make the argument that this is a relevant aspect of investment to look at for these communities.
* Could you actually look at multiple types of investment? And include pothole repair as one of them? Make a more general case for showing how low income communities overall receive less attention and investment than rich ones?
* How about access to parks, schools, medical care, recreation facilities, child-care, pollution levels, food? There are many other things you can look at.
* You could ultimately create an index of investment and then measure that throughout the city and test your hypothesis.

### a House is not a Home
* The idea is very interesting but the project is still too vague. There are too many options.
* Also, what kind of analysis are you going to perform, in addition to mapping these temporary structures, what is your point? What will you achieve through mapping this? What is your question?
* About the data sources: how complete are they? It seems like getting data on temporary / mobile structures would be very difficult. So, how complete are the datasets that you will be looking at? And if they are not that complete, how are you going to complement them?
* Overall, your proposal is lacking a specific question and needs to be much more focused.

### Analysis of the 125th street public space identity over time and space
* The overall intent of the project is interesting, however, the project is still too broadly defined and not focused enough.
* Specifically, what kind of data are you going to collect through your field work? Is this going to be enough to draw conclusions and create a full portrait of the "public space identity over time and space"?
* You need to focus your project much more and define some specific variables that represent "identity" and then collect information about those and map it.
* See some of the comments from the project above.

### The Men who built America
* This sounds like a very interesting project.
* The crucial thing here is getting or building the right datasets in time.
* One thing you need to think about is whether or not you will focus on their personal live or their businesses, or both. I'm not arguing for one or the other, but it might be too much to do both. On the other hand, you might have a good reason for doing both. Think about it and have a good reason for your choice.
* Think about different scales. You can collect data and create maps and analysis at the global or country scale, but you should also zoom in into a particular city or cities and explore their impact there, that will make your project much more interesting and dynamic.
* It's an ambitious project but I think you can pull it off, just make sure you can create the data or acquire it in time.

### Final proposal (NYC)
* From what I understand you want to compare income and educational attainment in New York City and see if there is a correlation.
* Although very relevant, this seems like an obvious correlation and your project needs more.
* Getting this data over time, in a way that makes sense and that allows you to compare these variables through generations might prove very difficult.
* Think about adding additional variables to your equation: access to transportation, access to open space, presence of libraries? What other factors could you bring into this project to make it more rich?
* Could you do an index for every neighborhood in New York and see how this index correlates to educational attainment?
* Also, you need to figure out how many people have come into each neighborhood throughout the years and take that into account.
