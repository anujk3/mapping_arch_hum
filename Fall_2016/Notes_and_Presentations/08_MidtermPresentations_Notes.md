## Midterm Presentation Notes

### Analysis of the 125th street public space identity over time and space
* Define gentrification, it doesn't need to be anything complex, just tell us what you mean by it and how you are using it in your project.
* Good way of mixing media in your presentation. Think about continuing with this in your final project. Maybe embedding images and sound in an interactive map?
* Are there "fuzzy" boundaries? How do you represent something that's not totally fixed or doesn't have strict boundaries? Think about how your represent the specific type of data that you are working with. It's not as fixed as other kinds of data.
* How do you know the data that you are gathering (qualitative data) represents the population? Is it a "representative sample"? How do your observations compare to the census?
* If you are going to use interactive maps, make sure you profit from their interactivity, zooming in and out, showing different kinds of data at different scales and embedding other kinds of media.
* Think about how to represent time and change over time.
* Define "history". What is the time period you are looking at? And why?

### Men who built America
* Think about using other kinds of media, photographs, detailed maps showing specific buildings.
* Show more detail in maps, plus labels and scale bars.
* Think about representing the global reach or the national reach of their businesses. Think about representing the whole production chain of their businesses.
* One very interesting avenue for pursuit could be just focusing on one aspect of their legacy, for example art or education and giving a very detailed view of how that has played out.
* Also, think about how to best represent time or change over time.
* Also, think about how show overlaps or comparisons between the different characters. As they are right now they each seem like a different chapter but they should work together better.

### Single-parent households and equity in New York
* The project is very interesting but is lacking some focus. Try to narrow it down a bit.
* The data analysis part is very interesting but you need to make it work better with the geographic part. Right now it feels like a different branch of the project, think about how to make it fit better.
* You can select a couple of neighborhoods where the proportion of single-parent households is large and concentrate your analysis on these sections of the city. That way you might be able to dive deeper and come up with specific proposals.
* The personal journeys angle is very interesting.

### In motion
* Since it might be very difficult to get precise data for your project think about focusing your analysis on satellite images. That way you can access a different data source that could also show slum clearance and new construction.
* Think about how to represent change and magnitude of change in interesting ways.
* In the end you might have to combine satellite images with vector data (collected or created by yourselves), but this might actually make your project very interesting and rewarding.

### Housing value and noise
* You can go one of two ways: either explore what different factors affect housing value (noise, pollution, proximity to transit, proximity to parks, educational level of schools, etc); or explore how different types of noise affect conditions in the city.
* In either case, your analysis needs to be more precise and focused and you need to be more rigorous.
* You could divide your noise complaints into temporary or permanent, or look into the different categories of noise complaints in the 311 data.
* Also, always remember that the 311 data represents the people who complain but not the actual levels of noise in the city.
* You could also actually try to measure noise levels and the city and compare it with 311 complaints, and try to see what variables are correlated with the complaints. This might actually be a very interesting avenue for inquiry.
