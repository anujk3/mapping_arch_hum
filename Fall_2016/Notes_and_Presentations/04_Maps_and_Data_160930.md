## Notes - Maps and Data (9/30/2016)

### 1. Assignments & Final Project
* Collect final project proposal
* 311 assignment (due on the 7th of October)

### 2. Make-up classes
* Set-up doodle to figure out when

### 3. Blog

### 4. Readings
* Alves, Exploring Literary Landscapes
* Walker, The London Underground Diagram
* O'Beirne, Google Maps vs. Apple Maps:
  * Be responsible for every pixel in your map / board / presentations (just like you are responsible for every letter in your texts)
  * Compare this to the deconstruction text at the beginning of the semester
  * Also look at [What Happened to Google Maps?](http://www.justinobeirne.com/essay/what-happened-to-google-maps) post, very interesting and complements this post well (evolution of Google Maps).


* Towards critical spatial thinking in the social sciences
  * How do we reflect uncertainty and ambiguity?
  * Render graphically things that are not explicitly spatial
  * [CIESIN](http://www.ciesin.org/) - GPW (Grided population of the world):
    * [Exits](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kyMbF2uuSIw)
  *  "Eye candy" problem: multidimensional visualizations, but how do we extract meaning from images?
  * Problems with geographic literacy:
    * Projections (Economist)
    * Spatial heterogeneity: tendency for phenomena distributed in many spaces, to be statistically non-stationary. Therefore, you cannot really generalize from spatial samples, because are always limited to the study area.
    * Spatial dependence (autocorrelation): tendency of spatial data to exhibit short-run spatial autocorrelation.
* Non-quantitative GIS (Marianna Pavlovskaya)
  * GIS as actually not that quantitative (power, negotiations)
  * Can a GIS view space in non-Cartesian terms?
  * Combining spatial data with qualitative data (p. 15)
  * Using ethnographic information in combination with spatial data
  * Mapping underprivileged ontologies
  * Importance of mixing methods (p. 16)
  * Challenge:
    * Complex relationships
    * Non-quantifiable properties
    * Unprivileged ontologies
    * Fluid human worlds
    * Create diverse human geographies
    * Use non-quantitative and non-conventional data in combination with more standard datasets (census)
    * It can represent unprivileged social ontologies
    * Enable mixed-methods

### 4. Emily demo
* How to create a dataset using Google Maps or Google Earth
* How to export it and import it into qGIS
* How to add latitude and longitude fields
* Export .csv to add attributes

### 5. Various
* Create an indicator map (2nd data frame) tutorial step 20 [here](http://www.qgistutorials.com/en/docs/making_a_map.html)
* How to package maps with layers through [QConsolidate](http://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/qconsolidate/)
* Chrome blocking scripts when you try to download things from the TIGER [website](https://www.census.gov/cgi-bin/geo/shapefiles/index.php).
* Dock the attribute table in the qGIS window: Under qGIS preferences, in the data sources tab and under feature attributes and table, there's an option to open attribute table in a dock window.
